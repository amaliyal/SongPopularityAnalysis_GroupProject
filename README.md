# Analysis of Songs' Popularity - GroupProject

This is a final project for the CFGdegree data specialisation with Code First Girls. It was done by [Alisa Yanovski](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alisa-yanovski/), [Amily Luo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/amaliyaluo/), [Blessing Ogechi Nwojiji](https://www.linkedin.com/in/blessing-ogechi-nwojiji-89a869b6/), [Hassanat Awodipe](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hassanatawodipe/) and [Madina Baimaganbetova](https://www.linkedin.com/in/madina-baimaganbetova/).  


## Project Description

The aim of the project is to investigate potential factors that might affect song popularity. The catalogue of the songs to be analysed and the popularity scores of tracks were obtained from Spotify, one of the largest music streaming service providers, with over 433 million monthly active users. According to Spotify, song popularity is calculated by algorithm and is based, in the most part, on the total number of plays the track has had and how recent those plays are. Generally speaking, songs that are being played a lot now will have a higher popularity than songs that were played a lot in the past. 

Asides Spotify, we also gathered data from Wikipedia, azlyrics.com and Kaggle.

Our analysis was mostly exploratory. We checked the correlation among a variety of songs’ attributes to answer two questions:
* What factors affect a song’s popularity? 
* How did these factors affect the song's popularity? 

By understanding what makes a song popular, artists and songwriters may better accommodate listener preferences in their production. In addition, listeners who have no idea of what songs to listen to may find it easier to make choices when creating their playlists.

Sub-components for our work could be found in individual branches.

The main branch consists a jupyter notebook with all our code (analysis_of_song_popularity.ipynb) and csv files for our data collection (Spotify: track*, Wiki & Kaggle: artist*, Lyrics: lyrics*), source combination (combined*), data cleaning (final*).

Because this is a class project, it also includes presentation slides, project report and meeting minutes. 

To execute the code, you may download the jupyter notebook and execute in order. There codes have been properly commented.
